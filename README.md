# Weather Dashboard

## Description

This is a dashboard application to easily look up current weather conditions and a five-day forecast for  any major city. Simply enter a city name in the input field, and the weather data will display on the page. Searched city names are saved in a sidebar and in local storage, allowing the user to select a previously viewed city and get up-to-date information. This application mostly utilizes Javascript, with some basic HTML for structure and CSS for formatting.
